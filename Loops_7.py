# ====================== Loops ================================

"""
Loops are two types
1. while loop
2. for loop


1. while loop syntax

while (condition):
    block of code

until and unless the condition satisfies in while the block of code will be executed.
there are three imp things they need to be considered in using while loop.
they are :
initialization , termination and updation

Question: take a input from user and print numbers from zero to till that input number.

"""

# var1 = int(input("Please provide a number :"))
#
# counter = 0  # this is initialization of counter (starting value)
#
# while (counter <= var1):        #this is termination condition
#     print(counter)
#     counter = counter + 1       # this is a updation
# print("END")

### NEVER REPEAT YOURSELF

#counter  = 3
while (True):
    print("Hello Sree")
